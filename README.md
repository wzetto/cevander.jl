An r+k-space cluster expansion (CE) model to derive cellsize-dependent Mean Square Atomic Displacement (MSAD) in the Cr-Mn-Co-Ni system. MSAD serves as a solid solution strengthening descriptor effective in high-entropy materials.

The program is part of the study ["Alloy design for strong and ductile Mn-alloyed Cr-Co-Ni medium entropy alloys for room temperature applications"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2025.148455 "paper link"); usage instructions are in `demo.ipynb`.
